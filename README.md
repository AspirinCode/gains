========
GAINS - Genetic Algorithm for Identifying Novel Structures - is a project
that enables molecular design and computational screening of
small molecules--in particular solvents--for energy storage applications.

Built on the molecular functionality of RDKit, future versions of GAINS
should be employable across a spectrum of small-molecule design problems.
