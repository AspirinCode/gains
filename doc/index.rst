Welcome to gains's documentation!
====================================

`GAINS` - Genetic Algorithm for Identifying Novel Solvents - is a project
that enables molecular design and computational screening of ionic liquid
solvents for energy storage applications.

Built on the molecular functionality of RDKit, future versions of GAINS 
should be employable across a spectrum of small-molecule design problems.

To see how to use it, please refer to the `README file 
<https://github.com/wesleybeckner/gains/blob/master/README.md>`_ in the Github repository.

This is an example of documentation of the software, using sphinx_.
