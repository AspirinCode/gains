Welcome to documentation for GAINS
====================================

`GAINS` — Genetic Algorithm for Identifying Novel Structures — is a project
that enables molecular design and computational screening of
small molecules. Built on the molecular functionality of RDKit, GAINS is employable across a spectrum of small-molecule design problems.

For installation, please refer to the `README file 
<https://github.com/wesleybeckner/gains/blob/master/README.md>`_ in the Github repository.

Development
------------------

GAINS is currently underdevelopment by researchers at the University of Washington. Our  research page can be found [here](http://www.prg.washington.edu).
